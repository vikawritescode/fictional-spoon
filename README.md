## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this project, I used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to put together a simple layout with consistent styling. I learned to use Flexbox to organize my layout in a consistent & visually-appealing manner, and I learned to use media queries to make my design responsive for multiple screen sizes.


### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to try mobile-first design, because I realize that I went about this one a little backwards. I'd also like to do more with Flexbox.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/K74l26pE4YA) - This helped me understand how Flexbox works visually and in practice
.
- [Learn How to Use CSS Media Queries In Less Than 5 Minutes](https://youtu.be/2KL-z9A56SQ) - This resource was very helpful for understanding how media queries work.
